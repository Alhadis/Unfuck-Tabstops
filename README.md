Unfuck Tabstops
===============

Source for a bookmarklet I run before bothering to read JavaScript on GitHub (or
anywhere else, for that matter). Replaces 2-space tabstops with tabs rendered at
4 columns (my preferred tabstop width, but the size can be customised to be 6, 8
or 3 if you prefer.

Seriously, this is how much I hate this shit. Expect to find this available as a
Chrome extension someday, once I get sick of routinely pressing this bookmarklet
each time I visit GitHub-hosted source code.


Used on the following sites
---------------------------
* [GitHub](https://github.com), including [gists](https://gist.github.com)
* [Node.js API docs](https://nodejs.org/api/all.html)
* [Stack Exchange sites](https://stackexchange.com/)
* [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web)
* Literally any other site where legibility of JavaScript code is fucked.

Expect this list to grow over time.
